# My Python Project (because I was bored)

This is a simple Python project, likely born out of a moment of profound inspiration (or perhaps just a Tuesday afternoon).

## Structure

*   `main.py`: The main entry point of the application. Currently, it just prints "Hello, World!".
*   `utils.py`: Contains utility functions.
    *   `helper_function()`: A sophisticated function that returns the string "This is a helper function."
*   `tests/test_utils.py`: Contains unit tests for the functions in `utils.py`.

## Running the Code

To run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Running Tests

To run the tests (assuming you have pytest installed or are running from an IDE that supports test discovery):

Navigate to the root directory and run:
```bash
pytest
```

*Disclaimer: This project might expand if boredom strikes again.*
